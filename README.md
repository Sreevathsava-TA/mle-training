Here is a clean and improved version of your `README.md` file for the housing price prediction project:

# Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict median housing prices based on various features like location, number of rooms, and proximity to the ocean. It employs machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests with hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/datasets/housing/housing.tgz). It contains information about the housing market in California, including features like house age, income, and proximity to the ocean.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the project, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sreevathsava-TA/mle-training.git
cd mle-training
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment using the provided `env.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate mle-dev
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Make sure to install the required Python libraries. If not using the `env.yml`, you can install them manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

### 4. Download the Dataset

The script automatically downloads the dataset from the following link:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/datasets/housing/housing.tgz
```

You can also manually download and extract the data using this link if needed.

## Running the Code

Once everything is set up, you can run the script to train the models and evaluate their performance:

```bash
python nonstandardcode.py
```

This script will:
- Download the dataset (if not already downloaded)
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Generate relevant features and handle missing values
- Train Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models
- Evaluate the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Model Performance

The final models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy. The Random Forest model typically yields better performance due to its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

## Screenshots

Below are some sample outputs from the model training:
